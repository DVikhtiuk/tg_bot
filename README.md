# tg_bot

    Simple Telegram bot for reporting. Collects information from 5 stores and sends it to the store owner. If it is disabled during the process, the bot remembers the work state and continues to work from the same place. The token is hidden. If you want to test the bot, you need to create your bot via BotFather and specify your token in the "auth_data.py" file.
